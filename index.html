            This was the one movie that gave me hope in the life and taught that I can live my life even if I don't fit into the societys narratives.
            A lot of critics wrote against this movie cuz it's diffrent from real incidents. But for me it was just a movie which was fantastic and 
            I was crying from beginning to end.
        <li><h3>LOVE SIMON</h3></li>

        This was the first movie I saw on the theme of coming out as a queer.
        It is perfectly made, and the final convo between Simon and Mom. Excellent!
        <li><h3>COCO</h3></li>
